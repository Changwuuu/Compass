   Welcome to Compass's documentation!
   ===================================
   
   Compass is an algorithm to characterize the metabolic state of cells based on single-cell RNA-Seq and flux balance analysis (FBA). 
   Its development was motivated by the challenge in characterizing the metabolic states of single cells on scale with current metabolic assays. Compass is an *in silico* approach to infer metabolic status of
   cells based on transcriptome data, which is readily available even in
   single cell resolutions. For a detailed description of the algorithm, refer to the
   `biorxiv
   preprint <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.912717v2>`__.
   
   These pages have guides on how to install and use Compass, including a walkthrough of an analysis to replicate figures from the manuscript.
